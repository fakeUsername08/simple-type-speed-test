Live your life and forget your age.
Life is too short to wait.
There is always something to be thankful for.
Life is better when you are laughing.
Live life to the fullest, because it happens only once.
You live the life you choose.
Love the life you live, Live the life you love.
Stop existing and start living.
Sometimes we just have to let things go.
Some people are so poor, all they have is money.
Life is a one time offer, use it well.
In the end we only regret the chances we didnâ€™t take.
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
True love stories never have endings.
